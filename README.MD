This university project, part of the 'Databases' course, involves creating a database-driven website for an animal shelter. We developed the underlying database using MySQL.

## Features

- The user can see the animals available for adoption
- The user can apply for an adoption for a certain animal
- The user can contact the animal shelter through a contact form
- Live counters showing how many animals have got adopted and how many employees are currently working in the shelter

## What isn't finished but we would like to do

Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to complete all the functionality of the website. What we wanted to add:

- A more secure way for storing employees' passwords
- Login screen for the employees
- A page for the employees to see which animals they have to caretake
- A page for the employees to see the adoption requests and be able to accept or reject them
- A page for the employees to be able to add a new animal in the shelter or edit an animal that's already in the shelter
- A page for the employees to edit their information
- A page for the supervisor to edit the employee's information or delete (fire) someone
- Multi-language support (currently only Greek language)
